# Overview

This repo contains codes to train model using Keras. Keras is a very simple and light lib, it is very suitable for quick-developing and realize your idea.

I listed three files there.

*  in `classifier_from_little_data_script_1/`, Building powerful image classification models using very little data.
* in `classifier_from_little_data_script_2/`, Using the bottleneck features of a pre-trained network.
* in `classifier_from_little_data_script_3/`, Fine-tuning the top layers of a pre-trained network
